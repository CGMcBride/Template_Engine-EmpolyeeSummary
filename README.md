# Template_Engine-EmpolyeeSummary

This assignment is to create a employee summary to on board to your company, I used node.js to perform the backend

### How it works

I will build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team Manager,Engineer and Intern. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This project will show all passed unit tests and generate the team.html page to show all the information.
